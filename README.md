In this lab I took the program from Lab 3 and added a factory pattern and a decorator pattern. The factory pattern will add the ability to output the amount of filtered objects with each button click, while the decorator pattern rearranges the buttons to the users demands in order to make the GUI more clear to understand. In order to implement the factory pattern I had to change how I filtered my data and broke them into individual files as well as creating an interface to help with the allocation of the filter. For the design pattern, I had to create a new class for the layout manager as well as new methods within OscarAwardsApp.java in order to add the new buttons into the GUI. The new factory methods are also called within OscarAwardsApp in order to replace the previously used filter methods.
